## Conclusions
Borrowers having high income have fully paid the loan.
Borrowers belonging to G grade have the maximum annual income and majority of them have paid the loan.
Borrowers belonging to Grade B are prominent among defaulters.
Default rate is highest when loan is taken for small business
Default rate is lowest for vacation
The revolving line utilization rate having value of 30 shows that borrowers exhibiting responsible as they are using only 30% of their available revolving credit where as grade G borrowers are at higher risk of defaulting with utiilzation rate of 80%

The above analysis with respect to the charged off loans for each variable suggests the following. There is a more probability of defaulting when :
Applicants have rented or mortgaged homes
Dti is between 12-18
Applicants who have 10-19 loan accounts
Applicants who have recent credit history
Applicants with unverified income
Applicants who are not verfied
Borrowers who are charged off fall under intrest rate of 13-17%.
